## Statistics 
Statistics is fun!

Here are the [consumer analysis article](https://data.quora.com/A-Robust-Statistical-Test-for-Ratio-Metrics) co-written by one of my previous GSIs: Johnny and [2018 FIFA worldcup article](https://data.quora.com/FIFA-World-Cup-2018-seen-through-Quoras-numbers). 

This explains how stats can be applied into the real world problems! ^^
